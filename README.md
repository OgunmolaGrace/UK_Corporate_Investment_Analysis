# UK_Corporate_Investment_Analysis
Financial modeling and visualization of UK Private Non-Financial Corporation (PNFC) profitability trends, 1997–2024
1. Data Integration (The Technical Lift)

Action: Sourced Gross Rate of Return metrics (GOS, GCE) for five major UK sectors.

Skill Highlight: Used XLOOKUP and Power Query to join and clean 16 time-series data columns from different external research tables.

2. Modeling & Visualization
Action: Formatted all data for consistent reporting (£ billion and %), then created dynamic Pivot Tables and four custom charts.

3. Strategic Analysis & Key Insights

Pulled three strategic conclusions directly from the dashboard visuals:

Insight 1: 
Profit Drivers: The volatile UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) sector contributed only 1.2% to total Private Non-Financial Corporations (PNFC) profit in 2023. The financial health of the sector depends on the Non-UKCS and Service Sectors.

Insight 2: 
Efficiency Leader: The Service Sector (SSP_NON-FC) runs the most consistent and highest rate of return, confirming it is the most capital-efficient contributor.

Insight 3: 
Volatility Check: The massive swings in the UKCS Gross Rate of Return consistently distort the overall PNFC benchmark rate, proving the need to analyze sectors individually.

4. Strategic Recommendations
Based on the data, I delivered the following recommendations:

Focus Investment on Service Sector Efficiency: Given the high and stable Gross Rate of Return in the Service Sector (SSP_NON-FC), future capital expenditure and analysis should prioritize projects within this sector to maximize overall corporate efficiency.

Decouple UKCS from Benchmark: When assessing economic health, analysts should rely primarily on the Non-UKCS Gross Rate of Return as the true benchmark, as the UKCS sector's extreme volatility and low profit contribution make the total PNFC rate misleading.

Monitor Capital Utilization: Future analysis should track the Gross Capital Employed (GCE) in the Service and Manufacturing sectors closely to ensure high profitability is maintained through efficient capital utilization, and not just due to a rise in profit (GOS).

5. Final Communication

Action: Designed a professional, interactive Dashboard for clear stakeholder viewing.

Storytelling: Structured the presentation to explain how changes in Gross Operating Surplus (GOS) and Gross Capital Employed (GCE) explain the final Gross Rate of Return, delivering strategic recommendations.
